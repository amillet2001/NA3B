Uhh-uhh-uhh, ohh-yeah, hmmm
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do
And you know one of these days, when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
Will forever be enough, so there ain't no need to rush
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough
I'll say, will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, will you marry me?
Singing, uh-oh-oh, uh-oh-oh
Uh-oh-oh, oh-yeah
How many girls in the world can make me feel like this?
Baby, I don't ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life
You know one of these days, when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
Will forever be enough, so there ain't no need to rush
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough
I'll say, will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, will you marry me?
And if I lost everything
In my heart, it means nothing
'Cause I have you, girl, I have you
To get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be better, better
The day when I
I'll say, will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, will you marry me?
I'll say, will you marry me? (the day I get on my knees)
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, will you marry me? (and what you do me, baby?)
Got me singing (uh-ooh, uh-ooh)
Got me singing (uh-ooh, uh-ooh)
Would you marry me, baby? (uh-ooh, uh-ooh, uh-ooh)
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do
