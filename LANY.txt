Here I am again, back to my old ways
Frozen with my thoughts
Wasting all my younger days
And I just can't decide, should I be alone?
Hate the way I am, up every night, glued to my phone
Please tell me why it's easy at first
But then it all breaks
The more you love, the more it hurts
And I was just fine if it didn't work
But now that you're mine
The more I love, the more it hurts, oh
Honestly, it's me, I am so messed up
Making all the ones who care about me wanna run
The sunset's black and white, it didn't used to be
I remember when it was pink skies, just you and me
Please tell me why it's easy at first
But then it all breaks
The more you love, the more it hurts
And I was just fine if it didn't work
But now that you're mine
The more I love, the more it hurts, oh
Yeah, oh oh
The more you love, the more it hurts, oh
I can't help myself
You're the one I want
It might be bad right now
But losing you would really suck
Please tell me why it's easy at first
But then it all breaks
The more you love, the more it hurts
And I was just fine if it didn't work
But now that you're mine
The more I love, the more it hurts, oh
Yeah, oh oh
The more you love, the more it hurts, oh
Yeah, oh oh
The more I love, the more it hurts, oh
