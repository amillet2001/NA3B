I've been trying to forget you
But I can't
You made me a fool
It ain't cool
It's like there's something
Missing in my life
Maybe it's you
It is you
I just can't get you out of my head
You are the reason that I wake up in my bed
I got you stuck in my mind
Can't get out, can't get out
Please, get out
I got you stuck in my mind
Can't get out, can't get out
Please, get out
I didn't expect you to like me back
I'm a mess, I'm a fool
I don't know how to act with you
When I'm with you
I'm sorry if it took so long
To realize that we belong
You and I
It ain't a lie
I just can't get you out of my head
You are the reason I wake up in the bed
I got you stuck in my mind
Can't get out, can't get out
Please, get out
I got you stuck in my mind
Can't get out, can't get out
Please, get out
Please, get out, oh
Get out of my head, get out of my head
Baby, please
Get out, get out, get out of my head, oh
Please, help me to forget you
I don't really want to
Can you tell me if
You really want me to stay
In your mind
In your life
I got you stuck in my mind
Can't get out, can't get out
Please, get out
I got you stuck in my mind
Can't get out, can't get out
Please, get out
I got you stuck in my mind
Can't get out, can't get out
Please, get out
Don't get out
