Lyrics
One day, one day, one day
Sometimes I lay under the moon
And thank God I'm breathin'
Then I pray, "Don't take me soon
'Cause I am here for a reason"
Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know someday, it'll all turn around because
All my life, I've been waitin' for
I've been prayin' for, for the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There'll be no more wars, and our children will play
One day (one day), one day (one day)
One day (oh-oh-oh)
One day (one day), one day (one day)
One day (oh-oh-oh)
It's not about win or lose
'Cause we all lose when they feed on the souls of the innocent
Blood-drenched pavement
Keep on movin' though the waters stay ragin'
In this maze, you can lose your way, your way
It might drive you crazy
But don't let it faze you, no way, no way
Sometimes in my tears I drown (I drown)
But I never let it get me down (get me down)
So when negativity surrounds (surrounds)
I know someday, it'll all turn around because
All my life, I've been waitin' for (waitin' for)
I've been prayin' for (prayin' for), for the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more (fight no more)
There'll be no more wars (no more wars), and our children will play
One day (one day), one day (one day)
One day (oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, one day)
One day (one day), one day (one day)
One day (oh-oh-oh)
One day, this all will change, treat people the same
Stop with the violence, down with the hate
One day, we'll all be free and proud to be
Under the same sun, singin' songs of freedom like
Wah-yo (one day, one day), wah-yo, oh, oh (oh-oh-oh)
Wah-yo (one day, one day), wah-yo, oh, oh (oh-oh-oh)
All my life, I've been waitin' for
I've been prayin' for, for the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There'll be no more wars, and our children will play
One day (one day), one day (one day)
One day (oh-oh-oh)
One day (one day), one day (one day)
One day (oh-oh-oh)
One day, one day, one day
