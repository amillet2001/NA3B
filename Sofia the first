I was a girl in the village doing alright
Then I became a princess overnight
Now I gotta figure out how to do it right
So much to learn and see
Up in the castle with my new family
In a school that's just for royalty
A whole enchanted world is waiting for me
I'm so excited to be (Sofia the First)
I'm finding out what being royal's all about (Sofia the First)
Making my way, it's an adventure every day (Sofia)
It's gonna be my time (Sofia)
To show them all that I'm Sofia the First
