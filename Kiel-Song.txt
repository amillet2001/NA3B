[Verse 1]
I'm two days into college
And I'm three lectures behind
There's this guy, let's name him Colin
He says he wants to be mine
But it doesn't really sit with me quite right
'Cause he doesn't really like the things I like
And I keep accidentally locking myself out of my dorm
In the middle of the night

[Verse 2]
I wake up kinda wired
And I wake up kinda cold
And I wake up kinda tired
But I'll just sleep in when I'm old
See, I don't like breaking rules
But don't like doing as I'm told
So, I just float around and keep my head down
And hope my life unfolds

[Chorus]
And еverybody's telling me that I'm doing so wеll
I try to trust them, honestly
I find it hard to tell
If I need work or I need rest
I try my best to try my best
I tell myself, I say out loud
"It's fine, I'll figure it all out"
I tend to forget
I'm still only quite young
In a way this life of mine has only just begun

[Post-Chorus]
I've got time
I've got time

[Verse 3]
I'm two days into college
With a busy, busy mind
That guy that we named Colin
He's so handsome, he's so kind
My friends tell me I'm crazy
Say I take it way too far
'Cause I told him that it's over
'Cause he doesn't play guitar

[Verse 4]
I'm only two days into college
And my bedroom is a mess
There's just so much that I want to do
That I have not done yet
There's just so much that I want to say
And far too little breath
Oh, my mind it runs so far away
It's easy to forget

[Chorus]
That to everybody else it looks like I'm doing so well
I try to see it, honestly
I find it hard to tell
If I've done wrong or I've done right
I need a good night's sleep tonight
They said, "Go out," I said, "Alright"
I think I won't, I maybe might
I probably should just take it slow
I'll be all good
But, God, I know

[Bridge]
The one thing that's important above everything else
Is to learn not to put all this heavy pressure on myself
I try believe it when I say
"If it's meant to happen, it'll happen anyway
I'll be fine"

[Outro]
I've got time
I've got time
That's where I'm at, to be honest
Just two days
Two days into college
