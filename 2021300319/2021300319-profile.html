    <p class="hobbies">Immersed in the nocturnal embrace, I find joy in playing the piano, fingers weaving melodies that echo through the silent night. Poetry books offer solace, each verse a whispered symphony of emotions. Beneath the enchanting glow of the moonlight, I stand, captivated by its celestial elegance. In these moments, amidst music, poetry, and moonbeams, I find my sanctuary.</p>

Your passion for teaching has ignited a spark within me, and your unwavering support has helped me grow both academically and personally.
