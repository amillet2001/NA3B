    <p class="hobbies">Immersed in the nocturnal embrace, I find joy in playing the piano, fingers weaving melodies that echo through the silent night. Poetry books offer solace, each verse a whispered symphony of emotions. Beneath the enchanting glow of the moonlight, I stand, captivated by its celestial elegance. In these moments, amidst music, poetry, and moonbeams, I find my sanctuary.</p>
    
    <p class="message"> I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for your guidance and inspiration throughout my journey as your student. Your passion for teaching has ignited a spark within me, and your unwavering support has helped me grow both academically and personally. Thank you for being such an incredible mentor and role model.</p>
