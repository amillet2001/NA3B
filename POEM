Stepping into a new life where 
One faces oneself
 

Some consider everything a race
and chase after them all,
While others find it difficult
to even tie their shoe lace.
 

Many here care for you,
but you care for a select few
 

Lots of leisure, lots of pressure
In the midst of which, some search for treasure.
 

The greatest invention being the headset
without which no one's heads are fit
More sleep, less work, but still
feeling tired every other minute.
 

Sudden decisions rare output
even don't care for taking next
More dance, more wishes,
Many an exam and test.


Suddenly, when you look back
The poster says 'The Endâ€™,
The 35040 hours of these four years
Are just like the three hours of a movie

 

Passing by in the snap of your fingers
Leaving behind many a memory that lingers.
