Title: "Lost and Found"

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

JESSICA (30s, frazzled) rushes into the coffee shop, visibly distressed. She approaches the counter, where BARISTA (20s, laid-back) is wiping down the espresso machine.

JESSICA
(panting)
Did anyone find a black wallet? I think I left it here.

BARISTA
(smiling)
Actually, someone turned one in a few minutes ago. Let me check.

Barista retrieves the wallet from behind the counter and hands it to Jessica.

BARISTA (CONT'D)
Here you go. Lucky day!

JESSICA
(relieved)
Oh, thank goodness! Thank you so much.

BARISTA
No problem. Anything for our regulars.

Jessica notices a HELP WANTED sign.

JESSICA
Actually, are you hiring? I could use a bit of luck in the job department too.

BARISTA
(smiling)
Funny you ask. We are. Wanna fill out an application?

They share a laugh as Jessica starts filling out the application, her day taking an unexpected turn.

FADE OUT.
