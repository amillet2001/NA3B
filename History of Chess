The history of chess goes back almost 1500 years.

The game originated in northern India in the 6th century AD and spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world. Later, through the Moorish conquest of Spain, chess spread to Southern Europe.[1][2]
In early Russia, the game came directly from the Khanates (muslim territories) to the south.[3]
In Europe, the moves of the pieces changed in the 15th century. The modern game starts with these changes. In the second half of the 19th century, 
modern tournament play began. Chess clocks were first used in 1883, and the first world chess championship was held in 1886. The 20th century saw advances in chess theory, and the establishment of the World Chess Federation (FIDE).[4] 
Chess engines (programs that play chess), and chess data bases became important.

The origin of the game

Earlier forms of chess cane from northern India during the Gupta empire,[1] where its early form in the 6th century was known as Chaturanga. 
This translates as 'the four divisions', meaning infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.[5
