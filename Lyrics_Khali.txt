How can I be sure before I look elsewhere?
Ask my walls, if you didn't believe us yesterday (not yesterday)
Show me your palms again, where did all this glitter come from? (glitter)
Whoever lied to you, life is a little bad
It's not even worth it anymore, you can see that my world is dying
My love is not in a new grave
Never say a lot of words or do too much
I'm in love with the one who's causing my pain
I need silence, she's hurt me but doesn't feel it, she's talking to me about booms
I've nourished my dark circles with all my pain, now it's cliffs
I don't know what it will take to get out of this malaise?
I need this, I need silence
She's hurt me but doesn't feel it, she's talking to me about booms
I've nourished my dark circles with all my pain, now it's cliffs
