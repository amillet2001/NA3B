#Water Lyrics
Make me sweat, make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
Make me sweat, make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
Normally
I can keep my cool, but tonight I'm wildin'
I'ma be, yeah
In a dangerous mood, can you match my timing?
Mm-mm, telling me
That you really 'bout it, why try hide it? Oh
Talk is cheap, so show me
That you understand how I like it
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
Whole body
Make me sweat, make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
Make me sweat, make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
Hopefully
You can last all night, don't get too excited (ooh)
Oh, privacy
You ain't gotta go nowhere, you can stay inside it
Can you blow my mind? Oh
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time (if I give you my time)
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before (before)
Can you blow my mind? (Blow my mind)
Set off my whole body
Whole body
Make me sweat (make), make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
Make me sweat (make me), make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water (make me sweat)
Make me sweat, make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
Make me sweat (make me sweat), make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
Make me sweat (make), make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
Make me sweat, make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
