HEY Here's a basic tutorial on how to use the for loop in Java:
public class ForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example 1: Looping through an array
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        System.out.println("Example 1:");
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Number at index " + i + " is " + numbers[i]);
        }

        // Example 2: Looping through a collection
        String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"};

        System.out.println("\nExample 2:");
        for (String name : names) {
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        }

        // Example 3: Looping with a different increment
        System.out.println("\nExample 3:");
        for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }

        // Example 4: Infinite loop with a break statement
        System.out.println("\nExample 4:");
        int counter = 0;
        for (;;) {
            System.out.println("Loop iteration: " + counter);
            counter++;
            if (counter >= 5) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

Output:

Example 1:
Number at index 0 is 1
Number at index 1 is 2
Number at index 2 is 3
Number at index 3 is 4
Number at index 4 is 5

Example 2:
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
Hello, Charlie!
Hello, David!

Example 3:
0
2
4
6
8
10

Example 4:
Loop iteration: 0
Loop iteration: 1
Loop iteration: 2
Loop iteration: 3
Loop iteration: 4

Explanation:

The for loop in Java is used to iterate over a range of values or a collection.
In Example 1, we use a for loop to iterate over an array of numbers. We use the loop control variable i to access each element of the array.
In Example 2, we use an enhanced for loop (also known as a "for-each" loop) to iterate over each element of a collection (names array).
Example 3 demonstrates how to use a different increment value in the loop. Here, we're incrementing i by 2 in each iteration.
Example 4 shows how to create an infinite loop using the for loop. We break out of the loop when a certain condition (counter >= 5) is met.
