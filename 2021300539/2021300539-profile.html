                <strong>Message for my IPT2 Teacher:</strong>
                <p>My message for my teacher is to make the class a lively discussion everyday, having the fruits of my teacher's learning be transferred to us
                    and make sure that every students that sir Millet handle will gather a lot from the lecture. With Git and Gitbash, this will have the usefulness 
                in my 3rd Year of College as we already have Capstone Research and will need this part to create a repository and document our research. Thank you sir Millet for this lecture! </p>
